# hello-world
Professional system for ensuring correct understanding and deployment of the Github infrastructure using historically proven methods involving 'printing', 'logging' or 'displaying' to console or window the variable (of string type) "Hello World!".

My name is Patrick, I live in Belfast (at time of writing) and I am endevouring to becoming a 
developer, beginning with web development. I am exploring frameworks such as bootstrap for style, node.js, Angular5 and React/Redux for application. I will also be looking into Python, using Django as a Framework for comparing the two langauges for building web apps etc. This will allow me to better understand the best use cases for each language. I am using Udemy a lot for my education and find the platform very efficient (or maybe I'm now just more eager to learn than I was at 19/20).

Anyway, enough rambling, this doesn't print strings to the console!

In this edit, i'll write the first version of my Hello World code in order to understand Github's commit process.
